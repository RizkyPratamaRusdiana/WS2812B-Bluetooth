# WS2812B-Bluetooth
Hi everyone, this time I am sharing a project to control the WS2812B led strip light through a smartphone application. In this project I only use an Arduino Uno and a Bluetooth HC-05. This Bluetooth will later function as an intermediary between the Smartphone and Arduino, where this Arduino will control the WS2812B led strip light.
